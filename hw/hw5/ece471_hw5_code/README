7.	Describe what your "something cool" code does
	My something cool is that the display outputs my name 'ZACh'.

 a).	The GPU is in charge of booting the Pi.  The GPU has it's own hardware and OS called ThreadX that boots the Pi.  Most ARM devices have a hardware specific MLO as the first stage in the boot process, which then gets moved over to uBoot for the second stage.
 b).	The /boot partition in the Pi is FAT32 because there already exists stable drivers for FAT32 and the firmware has to read it; it would be difficult to write firmware that would read from another partition type to boot when there already exists a working driver for FAT32.
 c).	Firmware is the generic name for the code/program that is responsible for loading the operating system kernel into memory and running it.
 d).	i2cdetect does not show those addresses for the following reasons:
	0x00 - Reserved: General Call Addresses
